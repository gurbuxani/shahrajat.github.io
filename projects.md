## Data Science/Machine Learning Projects

-  **[Music Recommender System using Apache Spark and Python](https://github.com/shahrajat/Data-Science/tree/master/music-recommender)** - a popular Jekyll theme I created when making this website.  You can [view a demo](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) or use it yourself to make a pretty website similar to this one by visiting the [project page](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme). The theme is extremely easy to install - you can have a site up and running in 2 minutes, and it is designed to look great on both mobile devices and laptops.

## Web Development

- **[shinyjs](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs)** -  easily improve UX in your Shiny apps, adds useful features to Shiny apps, and call your own JavaScript functions using plain R code.  Also includes a colour picker.  Check out a [demo online](http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-demo/). Available [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shinyjs) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs).

## Misc

I have several cool Java games I wrote, but I currently don't have a way to host the applet online without paying way too much money to buy a certificate.  I might find a way around that in the future.
