## Data Science/Machine Learning Projects

-  **[Music Recommender System using Apache Spark and Python](https://github.com/shahrajat/Data-Science/tree/master/music-recommender)** - A recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history. Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify. In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix).

## Web Development

- **[shinyjs](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs)** -  easily improve UX in your Shiny apps, adds useful features to Shiny apps, and call your own JavaScript functions using plain R code.  Also includes a colour picker.  Check out a [demo online](http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-demo/). Available [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shinyjs) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs).

## Misc

I have several cool Java games I wrote, but I currently don't have a way to host the applet online without paying way too much money to buy a certificate.  I might find a way around that in the future.
