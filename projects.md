## Data Science/Machine Learning Projects

Includes Projects from courses taken at NC State University: Machine Learning for User Adaptive Systems, Algorithms for Data Guided Business Intelligence, Foundation of Data Science

-  **[Music Recommender System using Apache Spark and Python](https://github.com/shahrajat/Data-Science/tree/master/music-recommender){:target="_blank"}** - A recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history. Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify. In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix).

-  **[Anomaly Detection in Time Evolving Networks](https://github.com/shahrajat/Data-Science/tree/master/anomaly-detection){:target="_blank"}** - Implemented Signature Similarity method for detecting Anomaly in time evolving graphs.  Because of the way the similarity is calculated, anomalous graphs are identified by two consecutive anomalous time points in the output.<br/>
Based on paper: [Web Graph Similarity for Anomaly Detection](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/836/2/webgraph_similarity.pdf){:target="_blank"}

-  **[Adwords Placement](https://github.com/shahrajat/Data-Science/tree/master/adwords-placement){:target="_blank"}** - Given that advertisement giants like Google, Yahoo only make revenue only if the viewer clicks the ads, it's important to make the decision of which Ads should be shown (in limited number of ads slots available) depending on the query typed. Implemented Greedy, MSVV, and Balance algorithms in R for a very simplified version of this problem statement. MSSV beats other algorithms in terms of total revenue generated.

## Web Development

- [Ongoing] **[spamtest](https://spamtest.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"}** - Building a Django Python Web app for predicting if an email content is spam. Predicts the spamminess score based on a ML model pre-trained on huge dataset.

- [2015] **[Minified Guess the Correlation Game](http://shahrajat.com/assets/apps/guess-the-correlation.html?#){:target="_blank"}** - Built a minified version of the famous Guess the correlation game.

## Talks

- [2016] **[Recurrent Neural Networks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Y3rc-Y1jryat7kkzpZStoprk2dc4fVnpmezkAcrv-c/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000&slide=id.g11048b17a6_0_51){:target="_blank"}** - Presented a brief overview and important applications of Recurrent Neural Networks in [CSC 591/791 Algorithms for Data Guided Business Intelligence course in Spring 2016](https://engineeringonline.ncsu.edu/onlinecourses/coursemarketing/SPR-2016/CSC591-791.html){:target="_blank"}.

- [2016] **[CSC 591 ADBI: GD and/or SGD for Logistic Regression](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ViSaw_DzYXfKMjt6JBoN1RbgIRVCkNj2q5XAG3wjPFU/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000){:target="_blank"}** - Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent are techniques used in optimization of objective functions in various Machine Learning models. Presented it in [CSC 591/791 Algorithms for Data Guided Business Intelligence course in Spring 2016](https://engineeringonline.ncsu.edu/onlinecourses/coursemarketing/SPR-2016/CSC591-791.html){:target="_blank"}.

- [2013] 
**[Introduction to Web Development](http://www.slideshare.net/rajatsshah/introduction-to-web-designing){:target="_blank"}** - Presented a brief overview and important applications of Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent in [CSC 591/791 Algorithms for Data Guided Business Intelligence course in Spring 2016](https://engineeringonline.ncsu.edu/onlinecourses/coursemarketing/SPR-2016/CSC591-791.html){:target="_blank"}.
