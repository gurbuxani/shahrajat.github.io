I enjoy writing <strong>useful & reusable software tools</strong> to help others &mdash; check out <a href="/projects">my projects</a>. I have also
recently become an avid and active R useR.

I'm addicted to soccer, <strong>travelling</strong> at any given (and non-given) moment, getting into philosophical debates,
and meeting new people :)

The <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also view my (somewhat outdated) <a href="/files/DeanAttaliResumeEU.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.

<span class="fa fa-globe about-icon"></span>
Grew up in <i>Tel Aviv, Israel</i>, moved to <i>Toronto, Canada</i> during my teens, worked in <i>San Francisco</i> after undergrad, crossed the border again to <i>Vancouver, Canada</i> for grad school, spent many months in other countries backpacking.
</p>

<p>I also have <a href="https://deanat78.wordpress.com/">an old blog</a>, mostly from high school and some old travelling trips, that I'll leave here just because I want to have a reference to it somewhere.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="mailto:rshah6@ncsu.edu">my email</a> and social media links at the bottom of every page. As I said, I love meeting new people so don't hesitate to send a message!</p>
<p>I do a lot of consulting work in R and Shiny, so feel free to get in touch if you want to discuss something like that.</p>
<p>If you're contacting me for very brief technical help/advice, please consider looking at the <a href="#feed-meeee">feed me section</a> below :)</p>

    I spend a lot of time on my packages and I make sure they're high quality.
    <br/>
    I try to always respond to questions or bug reports about my packages immediately.
    <br/>
    I spent a considerable amount of time developing the Beautiful Jekyll theme and I've gone through dozens of iterations on the instructions in order to ensure they are as simple as possible.
    <br/>
    Each of my technical blog posts and tutorials take many many hours because I really try to make everything as clear and useful as possible.
    <br/>
    I also get emails daily asking for some advice or help (mostly with R or Shiny), and I make an honest attempt at responding to everyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since I <i>am</i> devoting so much of myself to all this, it would be amazing if some of my hard work translated into some compensation so that I—a student in the most expensive city in Canada—will be able to shop at fancy Whole Foods once in a while :)
