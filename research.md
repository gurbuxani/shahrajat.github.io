Much of my research interest lies in Machine Learning for Data Mining related methodologies. I have gained experience in this field through research projects on Sentiment Analysis of reviews, Recommender System and Generalized Regression Models analysis.

I am also a __Graduate Research Assistant__ in the Center of Educational Informatics Lab at NCSU under the supervision of Dr. Min Chi. My task includes evaluating and building models for the challenging problem Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) for Intelligent Tutoring Systems(ITS).
