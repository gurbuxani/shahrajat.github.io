title: The Amaz(on|ing) summer in Seattle
---

Last summer was the longest time I have spent in a metro city in US and it was my first internship at one of the Big 4. This is a brief reminiscence of the amazing time I had in those 3 months.

To begin with, while I was in my 2nd semester of Masters studies, I was actively looking for Software Engineering opportunities for the coming summer. On a busy morning, one of the recruiters called me and asked me to schedule an interview for tomorrow.
